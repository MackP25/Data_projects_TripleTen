## Executive Summary
* This analysis aims to uncover patterns in the Zuber dataset, explore passenger preferences, and assess the impact of external factors on ride behavior.

### Research Question/Project Guidelines

1. Find the number of taxi rides for each taxi company for November 2017 and group them by most popular.
2. Determine if and how the duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays compared to other days of the week and other weather conditions.

### Methodology
* The data used for this analysis was initially downloaded as a text file and subsequently imported into Power BI for further processing.
* The majority of the analysis was performed within Power BI, where a new measure was created to calculate the count of orders per restaurant, providing valuable insight into order distribution across locations. 
* To maintain data integrity, filters were applied to remove any null or empty values from the dataset. Filters were also applied to display only restaurants with 5.0 ratings and highlight top-performing cuisines based on sales amount.

### Data Analysis
1. Domino’s Pizza: Leading in Popularity and Revenue Generation
    * These charts compare the rating_count and total sales_amounts per restaurant. Domino’s Pizza has the highest rating_count of  442 and the highest sales_amount at 5.0M.
  
2. Indian and Chinese Cuisines: Top Revenue Generators and Most Frequently Ordered
    * Through comparing order_count and total sales_amount by cuisine type, it is prominent that Indian and Chinese cuisines are the most popular among customers and generate the highest revenue.

### Results
This analysis consisted of three main research questions: What are the most popular restaurants? What restaurants generate the highest revenue and why? What cuisines are the most popular?
  * Domino’s Pizza, Pizza Hut, and KFC have the highest rating counts and order volumes. This indicates that these restaurants are the most popular among Zomato customers. 
  * Domino’s Pizza, Kouzina Kafe, and Sweet Truth (specializing in cakes and desserts) are the top-performing restaurants by sales amount. This aligns with the strong performance of pizza and bakery goods, which rank among the highest in both sales amount and order count, explaining the high revenue generated by these establishments.
  * Indian and Chinese cuisines generate the highest revenues and are the most frequently ordered on the platform. Bakery goods and pizza also perform strongly, ranking as the next most popular and revenue-generating cuisine categories.

### Conclusion
* Based on the analysis, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, and KFC are among the most popular restaurants on the platform, indicating strong customer preference and engagement. Additionally, Domino’s Pizza, Kouzina Kafe, and Sweet Truth (specializing in cakes and desserts) generate high revenue, supported by the strong performance of pizza and bakery items in both sales amount and order count.
*To capitalize on these insights, it is recommended that Zomato focus targeted advertising efforts on customers who frequently order from Domino’s Pizza to enhance retention and boost repeat orders. Expanding Indian and Chinese-inspired menu options across more restaurants could help meet customer preferences and improve satisfaction. 
* Encouraging user reviews through small incentives may help increase engagement and credibility. Furthermore, offering coupons for alternative restaurants could drive cross-platform engagement and increase order volume across a broader range of partners.
* The dataset contained a high number of blank or empty values, particularly in the restaurant name and cuisine fields, which may have impacted the accuracy of trend identification and performance comparisons. Additionally, there was a noticeable overlap and inconsistency in the categorization of cuisines, with many similar or duplicate entries, potentially skewing the aggregation of cuisine-based insights. These data quality issues highlight the need for improved data cleaning and standardization to enhance the reliability of future analyses.
