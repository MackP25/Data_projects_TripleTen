### Conclusion
* Conducting deeper analysis of previous years' data is recommended to understand the declining trend in pop music. Marketing efforts should include targeted campaigns aimed at core demographics of popular genres like electronic and hip hop. Additionally, product and marketing teams should explore opportunities to generate leads within alternative or emerging genres.
* Introduce intermediate pricing tiers between free and paid plans to lower the barrier for conversion. Given the high value of paid users, consider offering time-limited promotions and special deals to encourage upgrades. Additionally, implement a referral program that rewards users with a free trial of the paid tier for successfully referring new users.
* Rock is the most popular genre for free users- Fresh Beats should focus on promotions tailored towards rock and develop other ways to increase engagement from rock-listeners.
