# VACATION RENTALS

## Executive Summary
* The following analysis is to determine which neighbourhoods and property sizes are most attractive for vacation rentals and how much revenue they generate, to assist our client in deciding which properties to invest in.

### Research Question/Project Guidelines
1. Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
2. How much money did the most attractive listings generate?

### Methodology
* Standardized text by removing inconsistent capitalization and trailing spaces, replaced empty fields with "0", and stored cleaned data in new columns for neighborhoods and other key fields.
* Used Pivot tables and bar charts to identify top 10 listings and neighborhoods, analyze bedroom popularity, and summarize nightly revenue by listing ID.
* Added a column to flag top listings, calculated nightly and projected annual revenue (based on a 30-day sample), and transferred results to an existing sheet for reporting.

### Results

  * One-bedroom units are the most sought-after property size, followed by studios and two-bedroom apartments, reflecting a preference for compact, cost-effective living options.
  * The highest revenue-generating property is a **studio in Midtown** (User ID: **49946551**), followed by **one-bedroom units in Hell's Kitchen and the Lower East Side**, highlighting the strong profitability of smaller units in highly sought-after neighborhoods.

* Based on these insights, our client should consider investing in properties with 0â€“2 bedrooms located in the top-performing neighborhoods, where demand and occupancy rates are likely to be higher.
