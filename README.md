# Data_projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Business Intelligence Analyst TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Superstore_Cohort_Analysis| The following analysis is to determine how many users from the company's website are converted from product pages views to purchases and to track cohort metrics on a month to month basis, starting with the month of each users first purchase. According to our analysis, 29% of users who view the product page add the item to their shopping cart and only 36% of those users who add to their carts finalize a purchase through the company's website. Our analysis also shows that only 10% of users who viewed the product page ended up making a purchase.|
| 2 | Superstore Analysis | This project focused on identifying the top three combinations of months and states to provide insights on when and where Superstore should focus their advertising efforts.|
| 3 | Returns Analysis | The purpose for this project was to understand current trends in return rates for the Superstore dataset and suggest ways to reduce such rates.|
| 4 | Zomato Project | The purpose of this analysis is to develop an analytical dashboard and report that offers 
actionable insights into Zomato's business decisions regarding performance and 
customer satisfaction, with a focus on restaurant popularity, revenue trends, and 
top-performing cuisines.|
